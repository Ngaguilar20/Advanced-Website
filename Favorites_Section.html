      <h2>Favorite Movie Franchise</h2>
      <img src="da_bois_in_the_falcon.jpg" width="600" height="400">
      <h3>STAR WARS</h3>
      <p>This movie franchise was first introduced to me when I was in 3rd grade, and after that year I "grew out of it". I then actually started to hate, but that all changed after The Force Awakens released in theaters. My family started discussing if we should go watch, and before we went my dad suggested that we watch all the movies before going on. So we did, and ever since then my love for Star Wars returned.</p>

      <h2>Favorite Music Genre</h2>
      <img src="" width="400" height="500">
      <h3>Rock(Classic Rock)</h3>
      <p>The music genre that played all throughout the house as I was a child, besides Frank Sinatra. It is the one music genre that I would choose over any other. The picture above is a picture of me at a concert for the band U2. This was my first and only time going to a concert and it was amazing.</p>

      <h2>Favorite Super-Hero</h2>
      <img src="Spider-Man.jpg" width="700" height="400">
      <h3>SPIDER-MAN</h3>
      <p>The one superhero that always seemed to come back to me. Ever since I was a kid, I loved Spider-man. As like many kids did, I dressed up as Spider-man for Halloween and I always had a blast. Now that that is behind me, the next step is to watch the movies and play the games. The picture above is a picture taken from his latest game on the PS4.</p>

      <h2>Favorite Sports Team</h2>
      <img src="" width="300" height="200">
      <h3>LA Lakers</h3>
      <p>The team that has been pushed on me since I was a baby, and even before that. When my parents were still trying to name me, my mom's boss suggested the name Sha-kobe due to my Dad's love for the Lakers. It's the one team that we cheered for, even when they lost badly(Basically every game the past few years). We always went to go so at least two games per season and I loved going to the Staples Center to watch the Lakers.</p>
