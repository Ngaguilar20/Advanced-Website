      <h3>The one thing I always love to do, but sadly never get enough of.</h3>
      <p>This picture is moments before disaster struck. (My mom waking me up)</p>

      <h3>The second most common thing I do during my free time. I usually play on my PS4 nowadays, but I do have an Xbox, a PC, and a Nintendo Switch. I usually play FPS games, but I do play platformers and even racing games here and there.</h3>
      <p>This is a picture of the game that I usually play. I do know how controversial the game is in itself, but I still have fun playing and I don't see myself not playing it anytime soon. (Unless I can get Spider-man anytime soon)</p>

      <h2>Listening to Music</h2>
      <img src="spotify.jpg" width="500" height="300" title="Spotify">
      <h3>The one hobby that I constantly do everyday. Listening to music is one of those things that is perfect for almost every moment of your life.</h3>
      <p>This picture is of one of the music streaming apps that I use. I have used this so much, and I use it so much that I needed to buy the premium so I can use it to it's full potential. I have made countless playlists for my many moods that I have songs for.</p>

      <h2>Playing Basketball</h2>
      <img src="Basketball.jpg" width="300" height="400" title="Ball getting stuck">
      <h3>The one that sport that has followed me since my childhood. Ever since I was since I can remember, I was playing basketball. Even though I am pretty average, I still love to play the sport. It is the one sport that I can never live without playing.</h3>
      <p>This is a picture of one of the times I was playing basketball with my dad. We were just shooting free-throws, when I got so lazy I shot the most laziest shot in my life. What happened after was shocking. The ball landed at the back of the rim and just stayed there without moving. IT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER WITNESSED, while playing Basketball!!!!</p>
